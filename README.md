# Decentralized Autonomous Vehicle Access NFT

This project is an innovative NFT solution that represents **FHE-encrypted access rights to a Decentralized Autonomous Vehicle (DAV)**. Powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, this unique approach ensures user preferences for driving styles and common routes are securely encrypted within NFTs, providing privacy and programmability in smart transportation services.

## The Challenge of Transportation Privacy

In a world where data privacy is paramount, conventional approaches to vehicle reservations and usage lack robust security measures. Users are often required to share their sensitive driving preferences and habits when accessing autonomous vehicles, exposing them to potential misuse and privacy violations. There remains a pressing need for a solution that not only secures user data but also enhances the overall experience of accessing transportation services.

## Encrypted Access with FHE

The solution lies within **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, which allows computation on encrypted data without decrypting it first. This project utilizes Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete** and **zama-fhe SDK**, to implement these advanced encryption techniques. Consequently, users can enjoy peace of mind knowing their personalized driving preferences are protected while still enabling seamless interoperability with autonomous vehicle networks. By NFT-ifying these access rights, we are not only ensuring privacy but also creating a programmable and tradeable asset for smart transportation.

## Key Features

### 🚗 NFT Representation of Access Rights
- Users can hold NFTs that encapsulate their access rights to autonomous vehicles, with each NFT uniquely reflecting their preferences and entitlements.

### 🔒 FHE Encryption
- Leveraging Zama's technology, user preferences like driving style and regular routes are encoded, ensuring privacy while eliminating the need for data exposure.

### 🌐 Programmable and Tradeable
- This innovation transforms the way users interact with transportation services, allowing access rights to be programmatically managed and traded, paving the way for a decentralized market.

### 🛰️ Seamless Integration
- The system is designed to integrate smoothly with existing decentralized applications and services, promoting a cohesive user experience across the board.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama SDK** (Concrete, Zama-fhe SDK)
- **Ethereum** (Smart Contracts)
- **Node.js** (Server-side Logic)
- **Hardhat / Foundry** (Development Tools)
- **Solidity** (Smart Contract Language)

## Installation Guide

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Extract the downloaded project files to your desired location.
2. Ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your development machine:
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher, LTS recommended)
   - [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/)
3. From the root of the project directory, run the following command to install all dependencies, including Zama's FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do not use `git clone` or any URLs to download the project.

## Build & Run Guide

After successfully installing the dependencies, you can proceed with building and running the project.

### Compile Smart Contracts

To compile the smart contracts, run:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deploy Smart Contracts

To deploy the contracts on a local test network, use:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Run Tests

To ensure everything is working correctly, execute the tests with the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Example Functionality

Here’s a brief code snippet that showcases how to create an NFT representing a user's access rights:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract davAccessNFT is ERC721 {
    mapping(uint256 => UserPreferences) private _userPreferences;

    struct UserPreferences {
        string drivingStyle;
        string regularRoute;
        // Other user-specific preferences
    }

    constructor() ERC721("DAV Access NFT", "DAVNFT") {}

    function mintNFT(address recipient, uint256 tokenId, string memory drivingStyle, string memory regularRoute) public {
        _mint(recipient, tokenId);
        _userPreferences[tokenId] = UserPreferences(drivingStyle, regularRoute);
    }

    function getPreferences(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (UserPreferences memory) {
        return _userPreferences[tokenId];
    }
}
```

In this example, the smart contract allows us to mint NFTs that contain essential user preferences, securely stored and accessible only through the contract.
